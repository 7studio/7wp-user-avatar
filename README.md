# 7wp Local Avatar

Allows users to upload a custom avatar in their user profile. It's really useful when you use the same email address
on different websites and you don't want to use the same Gravatar (my case) :grin:

Most of the ideas of this plugin comes from [10up/simple-local-avatars](https://github.com/10up/simple-local-avatars)
but they were reorganised and enhanced by my mind :yum:

## Features

- Generates requested sizes on demand just like Gravatar!
- Enables rating of local avatars, just like Gravatar too!
- Uses the default Media library to choose the custom avatar (no custom UI).
- Lets users to crop their avatar in a square if needed.
- Displays a custom media state "User Avatar" in the Media list table.
